What is REPL? How is it useful?

REPL stands for Read-Evalute-Print-Loop. It is an interactive  computer programming enviornment that takes a user's input and evaluates them and then returns the result to that user. REPL is useful for mathemathical calulations, maintaining/testing code, or even just learning the language that supports a REPL.

Give an example REPL session in a language of your choice (copy and paste below your REPL session from the command line).
