Dynamic typing is the same as type inference. Discuss in favor or against that statement and provide examples to strengthen your arguments

This is false. Type inference is set once and it is set at compile time. However, dynamic typing is not fixed and the type can be changed at runtime. 

Example 

var value = 1
Println(value)
// error below since value has already been inferenced as a int. 
value = "hello"
Println(value)

However, you could do this in a dynmaically typed lanugae like python.
value = 1
print(value)
value = "hello"
print(value)
