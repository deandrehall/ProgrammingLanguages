A guessing game asks a user to guess a number. When started, the program picks a
number between 1 and 100. It then prompts the user to take a guess. The program
then provides a message if the value guessed is higher or lower than the number
it picked. When the user figures out the number, it displays the number of 
attempts the user took.

In a language of your choice implement the program using functional style (using
lambda expressions and immutable state/variables). Printing to the console is OK.
Reading users input is also OK. Keep your code in a separate file with the
proper extension so we can actually run the program. Provide a build script to
compile (if necessary) and run the program.
