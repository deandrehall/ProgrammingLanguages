Use any language of your choice. Given a number, write a function to compute the factorial of that number. Assume (no need for error checking) that the number is greater than 0. Implement the function using iteration (not recursion) but without mutating any variable.

Done in Scala.

def immutableFactorial(n: Int) : Int = {
      (2 to n).foldLeft(1)(_*_);
  }

No need for ; and also return type can be inferred, avoid that in cases where it's obvious.
