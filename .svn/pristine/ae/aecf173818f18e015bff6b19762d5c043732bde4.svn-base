We discussed C#, Clojure, Erlang, F#, Groovy, Haskell, Java, Ruby, Scala, and 
JavaScript in this course. What are some of the ways in which you'd classify
these languages (there is more than one way). Explain each classification and
group these languages appropriately in each classification.

Java, C# are statically typed language, strong typed, and imperative style language.

 
Erlang, Clojure are dynamically typed languages, strongly typed, and a functional style languages. 

Scala, F# are statically typed languages, strongly typed, and supports both imperative and functional style programming.

Groovy is a static and dynamically typed language, strongly typed, and supports both imperative and functional style programming.

Haskell is a static typed language, strong typed, and is a purely functional programming language. 

Ruby is a dynamically typed language, strong typed, and supports both impassive and functional style programming.

JavaScript is dynamically typed, weakly typed or untyped, and supports both supports both  and functional style programming.
