HW 4: Due 11:59PM December 2nd

**There will be no reviews for this Homework**

Feel free to give answers collectively, and also if you want to, you can call 
out something specific to yourself different from your pair.

(a) What languages did you use in this course? 

We used C++, Python, GO, Ruby, Scala, and Elixir.

(b) Which one of those you used for the first time?

Deandre: I used Go, Ruby, Scala, and Elixir for the first time during this course. 

Brian: I used Python, GO, Ruby, Scala, and Elixer for the first time. I only knew C++ going into this course.

(c) What are your impressions about all the languages that you used (compare
and contrast in your view)?

C++ was the language we were both most comfortable in, but it turned out
to be one of our least favorite of the 6 languages we used during the
course. After getting to use dynamic languages like Ruby and Elixir, which have very little ceremony and were very easy to pick up.

Go was definetly the most difficult language to work with. The first
night we used it to work on the first homework assignment we spent hours
trying to get the fibonacci function to work. After we got the hang of
it, the language wasn't too bad but it was very difficult for us to get
any work done initially.

Brian: My partner already knew Python, but for me it was my first time and the first time I used a dynamic languaged. I enjoyed using the langauge so I learned more about it out of class.



We origanally thought that assignment 4 would be a lot harder since we had quite a bit of trouble with the functional stuff in assigntment 1. However, using Elixir which is a purely functional language, we really did not have to think if we were mutating or not, since the langauge does not allow it, and it turned out to be very easy to do.
(d) What did you learn mostly in this course (I'm interested in hearing
your views, things you realized, things you found interesting, things
you did not like so much about any particular language, etc.)?

Brian: I used to think that learning a new langauge would take months and assumed that each language did stuff very differently like loops and syntax. Now I learned that it is really easy to jump into any language now that I jumped straight in all these new langauges. I only used C++ before this class, which is a static language. Now, after programming in all these dynamic languages I never want to go back to any static langauges. I actually had a lot of fun programming in these dynamic langauges epecially Ruby because everything just flowed so effortlessly. I just programmed and did not have to worry about all these little details. Lastely, I found functional programming very interesting, I
