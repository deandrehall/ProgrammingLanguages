Assign 4 Due 11:59PM November 18

Reimplement the problem we looked at in assignment 3, but this time with a purely functional programming language (a language that does not permit any mutability). Implement two solutions, one that is sequential and one that runs the code concurrent/parallel.

Once you complete the coding answer the following questions:

1. In what way, structurally, the code is different from the solution in assignment 3?

Replace this with your response.

2. In what way, behavior wise, the code is different from the solution in assignment 3?

Replace this with your response.

3. What are some of your observations and things you learned from designing and implementing assignment 3 and assignment 4?

Replace this with your response.
