Please keep all files related to a homework or an assignment within the appropriate directory. Files checked in outside of specific homework or assignment directory will not be reviewed or graded for that homework/assignment.

Check in and modify files as many times as you like. You will not be able to modify the files after the deadline.

You will work as a pair, both of you are responsible for the completed work in all assignments and homework. Reasonable effort is expected from each person.

The deadlines are strict, there will be no extensions. Don't email any code to Venkat or to the mailing list. Your last check in before the deadline will be graded. If your last check in breaks the code, both you and your pair will lose significant points.

Please feel free to ask for frequent reviews. See the reviews/readme.txt file for details on how to ask for reviews.

You can evolve the answers and solutions based on the reviews. Only the latest checkin at the time of review will be looked at. Also the final check in will be the only one graded.

Please read the academic honesty policy posted on the course mailing list.

Now to homework #1.

HW1: Due 11:59PM September 2nd

What are the differences between statements and expressions. Give examples. What are the benefits and the consequences of using each one of them. 

Feel free to read up, but do provide references to where you learn from. The description should be in your own words. If you find some really catchy phrases or quotes you'd like to use, do so, but put them in double quotes along with the name of who said (wrote) it.

Share your own experiences, observations, things that may have intrigued you.

Your answer goes here:





Expressions are evaluated to produce a single value, for example:
9 != 10
5 % 2
8 - 6

Statements perform commands, for example:
a = 3  /* assignment statements */
string n = "nice" /* variable declaration */
control flow statements

The benefit of statements is that they allow for the execution of commands, such as calling a void function or printing output. The disadvantage of statements would be that they may have the unintended consequence of mutating variables, which may cause errors after the statement has been executed.

The benefit of expressions is that they tend to produce "cleaner" code when used in place of statements whenever possible. Using expressions also prevent variable mutations, resulting in code that is less prone to errors caused by variable mutation. The drawback to using expressions is that you may want to perform commands, such as looping a particular block of code, in which case a statement would be used.

Code written using mainly expressions tends to be easier to read and less prone to errors caused by variable mutation. This is in contrast to code written with many statements, which often mutate variables and more difficult to read. In order to avoid these disadvantages, expressions should be used in place of statements whenever possible.
