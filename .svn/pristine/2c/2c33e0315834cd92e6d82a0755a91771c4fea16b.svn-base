Scala and JavaScript are quite different in nature, yet they have a few things in common. Identify some really powerful features that they have in common, explain what they provide, and how they are useful.

The most powerful features that Scala and JavaScript have in
common would be higher-order functions and lambda functions. Higher order functions allow
functions to recieve other functions as paramaters and return a function
as a result. Lambda functions allow you to create functions without
names. An example of this in javascript woult be 

var mult = function(x){
    return function(y){
        return x*y;
    };
};

multVar = mult(2);
multVar(4) == 8;

in this example, the function mult returns a lambda function which
multiplies the values x and y. By passing the value 2 to mult function,
any values passed to multVar will be multiplied by 2. This is useful
because it allows you to bind functions to a variable, and pass that
variable to other functions, or map the values returned by the lambda.

Total [10]: -1 In both we create constructors instead of classes though it appears as classes....
