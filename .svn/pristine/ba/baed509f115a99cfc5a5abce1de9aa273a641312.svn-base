Given a position n, the Fibonacci number at that position is defined using recursion as:

1 if n < 2
fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) for n >= 2

Using a language of your choice, implement the fibonacci function for a given n, using tail call recursion (not iteration), that is the call to the function should be at the last position in the recursion.
Also, avoid mutating any (global) state/variables to achieve this solution.

Save the code into a file with the proper extension. Provide a simple build file that will compile (if necessary) and run your code for some sample values of n.
