HW 4: Due 11:59PM December 2nd

**There will be no reviews for this Homework**

Feel free to give answers collectively, and also if you want to, you can call 
out something specific to yourself different from your pair.

(a) What languages did you use in this course? 

We used C++, Python, GO, Ruby, Scala, and Elixir.

(b) Which one of those you used for the first time?

Deandre: I used Go, Ruby, Scala, and Elixir for the first time during
this course. I really enjoyed using Elixir and Ruby. I was really
suprised with how much I enjoyed using Elixir beucase initially a
functional programing language sounded that it would be restrictive but
I eventually got used to it and it was quite nice to write code in.

(c) What are your impressions about all the languages that you used (compare
and contrast in your view)?

C++ was the language we were both most comfortable in, but it turned out
to be one of our least favorite of the 6 languages we used during the
course. After getting to use languages like Ruby and Scala which have
very little ceremony and were very easy to pick up, we realized that C++
wasn't going to be a language we woudld use more than just once.

Go was definetly the most difficult language to work with. The first
night we used it to work on the first homework assignment we spent hours
trying to get the fibonacci function to work. After we got the hang of
it, the language wasn't too bad but it was very difficult for us to get
any work done initially.

I really enjoyed using Elixir. At first I thought that a functional
language would be restricting, but after getting used to functional
programming it was very nice to use. The function pattern matching
offered in Elixir was something I had never seen before so it was really
cool to learn about and implement.

(d) What did you learn mostly in this course (I'm interested in hearing
your views, things you realized, things you found interesting, things
you did not like so much about any particular language, etc.)?

Replace this with your response.
