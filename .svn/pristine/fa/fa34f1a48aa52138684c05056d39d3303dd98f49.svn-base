What alternatives (mention more than two) are available to ease the pain of
programming concurrency? Explain their strengths and weaknesses.

Actor based concurrency, no shared mutability, thus do not have to worry about race conditions, make sure the message you send through threads are immutable.
STM(Software transactional memory) allows for controlling access of
shared memory when using concurrency. The benefit of STM is that no
thread needs to wait for access to a resource. Differnt threads can
modify differnt parts of a data structure, which would normally not be
allowed with the same lock.
