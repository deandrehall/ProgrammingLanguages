How is it possible for languages to support infinite sequences?

languages are able to support infiinte sequences by using lazy
evaluation. By delaying the valuation of an expression, you could create
a list of infinite size without worring about the size of the value. A
In the example of the infinite list of fibonacci number, calculating the
nth term would only require the evalution of the first n values instead
of the entire infinite list of values.
