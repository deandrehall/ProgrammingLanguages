details:                          
See common code repeated multiple times. Let's remove that duplication while keeping the different parts separate.

Giving a blank line in the output between versions will make it easier to read the output and not have to scan every line looking for where one ends and the next starts. Please care about readability of what we create.

synopsis: not much difference in performance, revisit 

details:                                             
The concurrent run takes about the same time as the sequential run.
In the concurrent solution, the calls to the Amazon page do not have to go one at a time. They can go concurrently. When the response arrives and we get ready to push the data to the list/array is when we need to synchronize.

Ruby file naming convention: amazonScraper.rb to amazon_scraper.rb

Please format the table so it is easy to read the content.

Please proceed to the next step.

In Ruby, function names are written as some_function instead of someFunction.
