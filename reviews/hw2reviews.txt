synopsis: a few things to tweak 

details:
2. "...is allowing for memorization..." Did you mean memoization?

5. Yes, but we can make this stronger. While someFunction is running, the caller may be using input2 and it can't predict when someFunction will change it. This leads to bugs.

synopsis: let's revisit 2 and 5 

details:
2. Please delete and start over this part. I gave clues for this on the mailing list. Don't start with mutability/immutability, but instead the key capabilities of FP.

5. What is the consequence of this to the caller or user of the function?

6. Good
